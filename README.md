# riverpod_test_app

A small sample Flutter app that is part of a case study exploring Riverpod as a state management solution. The project is intended to be a simple, easy-to-read playground to test architecture choices, provider patterns, and the capabilities of Riverpod in realistic but minimal app scenarios.

## Purpose

This repository is a case study:
- To evaluate Riverpod patterns.
- To test how different state management architectures affect testability.

## Goals

- Keep the app intentionally small and focused on state-management concerns.
- Demonstrate clean separation of concerns (UI, logic, data).

## Resources

- Riverpod documentation: https://riverpod.dev
